description: Join us in one of our bridged chatrooms

Tech and Coffee #publichangouts are a bunch of tech savvy people hanging out. Below are a few examples of the topics we may discuss. Youâ€™ll find that we often stray off topic and devolve into rambling. All of our chatrooms bridge into one another using [Matrix](https://matrix.org/).

We usually talk about one or more of the following:

- Linux/Windows/macOS/UNIX
- General computing
- Mobile devices
- Code/hacking
- Videography & photography
- Coffee
- Sleeping
- News and current events
- The old glory days of G+
