1. It is everyone's responsibility to make Tech and Coffee a place where people want to hang out. We want to make Tech and Coffee awesome, and you should too. We can't make it awesome without your help.
2. While debate and discussion is fine, we won't tolerate rudeness, offensive profanity, insulting language, personal attacks or purposeless inflammatory language. This includes offensive remarks regarding religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, racial, sexist, or ethnic slurs, and inappropriate references to explicit acts.
3. We do not allow posts or links to sites that are sexual in nature or that violate our community standards.
4. We ask that you be conscious that there may be people under the age of 18 in the server or in the general vicinity of an adult in the room. Administrators or mods may ask you to watch your language in voice rooms during this time.
5. By entering the server you are agreeing to these principles and, if asked, will leave the server temporarily when an administrator deems that you have violated the spirit of the community.

These are guidelines only and can't anticipate everything. Consequently we reserve the right to take any actions we deem appropriate to ensure Tech and Coffee is not disrupted or abused in any way. We reserve the right to ban anyone who willfully violates the principles, as access to our room is a privilege and not a right.
