> The original "and Coffee" hangout

Tech and Coffee was started by a few telecommuters who needed some human interaction with other telecommuters. One day for kicks George Doscher decided to make the hangout public. From that day on we have had a constant flow of really interesting visitors.

Most days we discuss almost anything under the sun but mostly we seem to flow back to tech related issues.

The Tech and Coffee logo was created by Joey Esquivel.
