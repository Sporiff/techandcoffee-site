## The original "and Coffee" hangout

Tech and Coffee was a video hangout started by telecommuters looking for interaction. One day, George Doscher decided to make the hangout public. We've had a constant flow of interesting visitors ever since.

We discuss whatever takes our interest, but we always end up looping back to tech topics. If you're interested, grab your favorite beverage and head over to our [Hangouts page].
