## A Virtual Water Cooler For The World of Tech

Tech and Coffee #publichangouts are a bunch of tech savvy people hanging out. Below are a few examples of the topics we may discuss. You'll find that we often stray off topic and devolve into rambling.

- Linux/Windows/macOS/UNIX
- General computing
- Mobile devices
- Code/hacking
- Videography & photography
- Coffee
- Sleeping
- News and current events
- Discussing the old glory days of G+

We are the original "and Coffee" hangout. There are a few clones out there but don't be fooled! Make sure one of our admins is in the room.
