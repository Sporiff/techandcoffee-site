## A Virtual Water Cooler For The World of Tech

Tech and Coffee #publichangouts is run by a bunch of tech savvy people. Below are a few examples of the topics we may discuss; but you will find that we often stray off topic and just shoot the sh!t.

- Linux / Windows / Mac / UNIX
- General Computing
- Mobile Devices
- Code / Hacking
- Videography & Photography
- Coffee
- Sleeping
- News and Current Events
- Discussing the old glory days of G+

We are the original "and Coffee" hangout. There are a few clones out there - don't be fooled; make sure that one of our admins or hosts are in the room.
